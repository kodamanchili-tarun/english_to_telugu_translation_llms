# Fine-Tuning Llama-7b Model for Telugu Translation

Welcome to the repository for fine-tuning the Llama-7b model for Telugu translation! This README will guide you through the file structure and steps to get started with fine-tuning and using the model for Telugu translation.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **FineTuning**: Contains scripts and files related to fine-tuning the Llama-7b model for Telugu translation.

   - `translate_alpaca_dataset_to_telugu.py`: Translates the Alpaca dataset used for fine-tuning into Telugu.
   - `finetune.py`: Code for supervised fine-tuning after loading the Pretrained model either from local storage or Hugging Face.

2. **Pretraining**: Includes any pretraining scripts or resources used for the Llama-7b model.

   - `download_base_model`: Downloads the base model from Hugging Face for pretraining.
   - `script.sh`: Pretraining parameter arguments script.
   - `run_pretraining.py`: Code for PreTraining the downloaded model on the datasets.
   - `merge_lora_with_llama.py`: Merges the learned weights from lightweight finetuning (LORA) with the original model.

3. **Tokenizer**: Contains scripts or files related to tokenization specific to Telugu language.

   - `tokenizer.py`: Scrapes tokens from the specified dataset using the Sentence Piece Trainer.
   - `merge_tokenizer.py`: Merges the tokens scraped above with the original downloaded model.

4. **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies and libraries required to run the code successfully.

## Getting Started

To get started with fine-tuning the Llama-7b model for Telugu translation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llama-7b-telugu-translation.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies using `pip`.

   ```bash
   cd llama-7b-telugu-translation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Prepare Data**: Create a folder named 'data' and add the datasets you want to pretrain and fine-tune on.

4. **Tokenization (Optional)**: If you need custom tokenization for Telugu language:
   - Run `python tokenizer.py`
   - Run `python merge_tokenizer.py`

5. **Pretraining (Optional)**: If you want to perform pretraining on the Llama-7b model:
   - Run `python download_base_llama2-7b-hf.py`
   - Run `./script.sh` (This will execute `run_pretrain.py` and perform pretraining)
   - Run `python merge_lora_with_llama.py`
   
6. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Use the scripts provided in the `FineTuning` directory to fine-tune the Llama-7b model for Telugu translation:
   - Run `python translate_alpaca_dataset_to_telugu.py`
   - Run `python finetune.py`

7. **Usage**: Once fine-tuned, you can use the model for Telugu translation tasks. Ensure you publish it to Hugging Face or follow specific deployment instructions.
